## Sight Word Helper ##


## Audience ##
  Parents of 3-8 year olds learning how to read and spell.
## Summary ##

  My 5 year old has to learn 10 lists of 10+ sight words by the end of 5th grade.  Most kids have a stage on the way to reading where they just need to memorize sight words.  Weâ€™ve scrounged together sight word cards bought at the store, created 3 x 5 cards, and in the end just resorted to having him read off of the sheets he got from class because it was just too much work to keep up with.


## Challenge it Addresses ##
  This alleviates time and hassle making flash cards for learning sight words.

## Solution to Challenge ##
  The problem is that practicing sight words is a lot of work, and there are more user friendly ways than reading them off a sheet.  A flash card app that lets you store word sets will make learning and spelling sight words easier on parents and more fun for students.

## Mission ##

  We are here to make the lives of parents easier and make learning easier for kids.
